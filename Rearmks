Uptil now cvd/cvd_divergence_rmultiple_backtest.pine
produce insane results

it contains Volume integration - Good
in future we can integrate the more indicator like 
1- RSI - just checked, Works Good, but very Fewer Signals. maybe Avoid?
2- Add Trend Alignment (EMAs for trend) - GREAT WORK on 1Day as others. So we can also refine this setup later on.
3- Strength of Divergence
4- And more, find out what
5- also check we can make things better for cvd_divergence
So first implement all Independently and then apply combinations of them
then find results against


1- Each coins - Diff Time frames - analysis - Give each coin of its own setup against eachtime - QUITE TIME NEEDED TO ANALYZZZEEEEE.....


Emm... Above consideration works with 1D TF we have to nourish Cvd_Divergence for lower TFs...

POINT 2 is being Done... comeback strogn tiomow

Remember CVD IS strong Concepts for TRADING, we implemented 2 precise indicator which have +ve TRADING Resutls.
