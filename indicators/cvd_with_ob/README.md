# CVD with Order Blocks Implementation

This implementation combines Cumulative Volume Delta (CVD) analysis with Order Block detection to create a comprehensive trading strategy indicator.

## Implementations

### 1. Basic Implementation (basic_cvd_ob.pine)

A foundational approach combining CVD with Order Blocks. See details in [Basic Implementation](#basic-implementation-basic_cvd_obpine) section below.

### 2. Multi-SMA Implementation (cvd_ob_multi_sma.pine)

An enhanced version using multiple SMAs for more refined signal generation and trend confirmation.

#### Key Features

- Triple SMA system for CVD analysis:
  - Fast (10 periods): Quick reaction to changes
  - Medium (21 periods): Intermediate confirmation
  - Slow (50 periods): Long-term trend validation
- Price SMA confirmation (10 and 21 periods)
- Signal strength classification
- Enhanced Order Block detection

#### Signal Types

1. **Strong Signals**

   - Requires alignment of all three CVD SMAs
   - Price momentum confirmation
   - Trend alignment with price SMAs
   - Larger visual indicators

2. **Medium Signals**
   - Requires alignment of fast and medium CVD SMAs
   - Less stringent criteria than strong signals
   - Smaller visual indicators

#### Parameters

| Category      | Parameter    | Default | Description              |
| ------------- | ------------ | ------- | ------------------------ |
| CVD SMAs      | Fast         | 10      | Quick momentum detection |
|               | Medium       | 21      | Intermediate trend       |
|               | Slow         | 50      | Long-term trend          |
| Price SMAs    | Fast         | 10      | Short-term price trend   |
|               | Slow         | 21      | Medium-term price trend  |
| Order Blocks  | Lookback     | 10      | OB formation period      |
| Visualization | Show Zones   | true    | Toggle OB zones          |
|               | Transparency | 70      | Zone visibility          |

## Core Concepts

### Cumulative Volume Delta (CVD)

- Measures buying/selling pressure using volume and price movement
- Calculated as cumulative sum of volume Ã— (close - open)
- Helps identify underlying momentum and potential reversals
- Uses SMA for trend smoothing and momentum calculation

### Order Blocks (OB)

- Key supply/demand zones where significant price moves originate
- Identified using:
  - Volatility (ATR-based candle size comparison)
  - Price action (strong moves followed by reversal attempts)
  - Momentum continuation patterns

## Basic Implementation (basic_cvd_ob.pine)

### Key Components

1. **CVD Analysis**

   - Momentum tracking using SMA
   - Configurable length for different trading styles
   - Real-time calculation of buying/selling pressure

2. **Order Block Detection**

   - ATR-based volatility measurement
   - Significant candle identification (>120% ATR)
   - Price action pattern recognition
   - Separate bullish and bearish OB detection

3. **Signal Generation**
   - Bullish: Positive CVD momentum + Bullish Order Block
   - Bearish: Negative CVD momentum + Bearish Order Block
   - Visual signals with arrow indicators

### Parameters

| Parameter         | Description                         | Default |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------- |
| CVD Length        | Period for momentum calculation     | 20      |
| OB Lookback       | Periods to analyze for OB formation | 10      |
| Show OB Zones     | Toggle zone visualization           | true    |
| Zone Transparency | Visual clarity adjustment           | 70      |

### Visual Components

- Green zones: Bullish Order Blocks
- Red zones: Bearish Order Blocks
- Up arrows: Bullish signals
- Down arrows: Bearish signals
- Blue line: CVD momentum (hidden by default)

## Usage Guidelines

1. **Timeframe Selection**

   - Higher timeframes (4H+): More reliable Order Blocks
   - Lower timeframes: More signals, higher noise

2. **Signal Interpretation**

   - Strong signals: OB zones with aligned CVD momentum
   - Weak signals: Opposing CVD momentum in OB zones
   - Consider overall market context

3. **Risk Management**
   - Use OB zones as stop loss levels
   - Consider CVD momentum for position sizing
   - Monitor signal strength for trade management

## Planned Improvements

### Short Term

1. Add multi-timeframe analysis support
2. Implement OB strength classification
3. Include volume profile at OB levels

### Long Term

1. Historical performance tracking
2. Advanced risk management features
3. Machine learning-based signal filtering
4. Integration with other indicators
5. Custom alert conditions
