# CVD with Order Blocks Implementation

This folder contains implementations that combine Cumulative Volume Delta (CVD) analysis with Order Block detection.

## Basic Implementation (basic_cvd_ob.pine)

A simple implementation that combines CVD momentum with Order Block detection to generate trading signals.

### Features:

- CVD calculation and momentum tracking
- Order Block detection using ATR-based volatility
- Combined signals when CVD aligns with Order Blocks
- Visual representation of Order Block zones
- Configurable parameters for both CVD and Order Block detection

### Parameters:

- CVD Length: Period for CVD momentum calculation
- Order Block Lookback: How far back to look for Order Block formation
- Show Order Block Zones: Toggle visibility of Order Block zones
- Zone Transparency: Adjust the transparency of Order Block zones

### Signals:

- Bullish: When positive CVD momentum aligns with bullish Order Block
- Bearish: When negative CVD momentum aligns with bearish Order Block

### Future Improvements:

1. Add multi-timeframe analysis
2. Implement Order Block strength classification
3. Add volume profile analysis at Order Block levels
4. Include historical performance tracking
5. Add risk management features
