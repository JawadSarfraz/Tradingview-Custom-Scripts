# CVD with Order Blocks Implementation

This implementation combines Cumulative Volume Delta (CVD) analysis with Order Block detection to create a comprehensive trading strategy indicator.

## Core Concepts

### Cumulative Volume Delta (CVD)

- Measures buying/selling pressure using volume and price movement
- Calculated as cumulative sum of volume Ã— (close - open)
- Helps identify underlying momentum and potential reversals
- Uses SMA for trend smoothing and momentum calculation

### Order Blocks (OB)

- Key supply/demand zones where significant price moves originate
- Identified using:
  - Volatility (ATR-based candle size comparison)
  - Price action (strong moves followed by reversal attempts)
  - Momentum continuation patterns

## Basic Implementation (basic_cvd_ob.pine)

### Key Components

1. **CVD Analysis**

   - Momentum tracking using SMA
   - Configurable length for different trading styles
   - Real-time calculation of buying/selling pressure

2. **Order Block Detection**

   - ATR-based volatility measurement
   - Significant candle identification (>120% ATR)
   - Price action pattern recognition
   - Separate bullish and bearish OB detection

3. **Signal Generation**
   - Bullish: Positive CVD momentum + Bullish Order Block
   - Bearish: Negative CVD momentum + Bearish Order Block
   - Visual signals with arrow indicators

### Parameters

| Parameter         | Description                         | Default |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------- |
| CVD Length        | Period for momentum calculation     | 20      |
| OB Lookback       | Periods to analyze for OB formation | 10      |
| Show OB Zones     | Toggle zone visualization           | true    |
| Zone Transparency | Visual clarity adjustment           | 70      |

### Visual Components

- Green zones: Bullish Order Blocks
- Red zones: Bearish Order Blocks
- Up arrows: Bullish signals
- Down arrows: Bearish signals
- Blue line: CVD momentum (hidden by default)

## Usage Guidelines

1. **Timeframe Selection**

   - Higher timeframes (4H+): More reliable Order Blocks
   - Lower timeframes: More signals, higher noise

2. **Signal Interpretation**

   - Strong signals: OB zones with aligned CVD momentum
   - Weak signals: Opposing CVD momentum in OB zones
   - Consider overall market context

3. **Risk Management**
   - Use OB zones as stop loss levels
   - Consider CVD momentum for position sizing
   - Monitor signal strength for trade management

## Planned Improvements

### Short Term

1. Add multi-timeframe analysis support
2. Implement OB strength classification
3. Include volume profile at OB levels

### Long Term

1. Historical performance tracking
2. Advanced risk management features
3. Machine learning-based signal filtering
4. Integration with other indicators
5. Custom alert conditions
